# Bisection Method Root Finder

This is a simple implementation of the Bisection Method for finding the root of an equation. It uses an interactive web interface where you can input a variable and a mathematical equation. The algorithm then performs the Bisection Method to find the root of the equation.

## Features

- Allows users to input a variable (default is `x`).
- Allows users to input a mathematical equation (e.g., `x^3 - x - 11`).
- Automatically finds an initial range where the function changes sign.
- Uses the Bisection Method to iteratively find the root of the equation.
- Displays the root with an approximation and the number of iterations required.

## How it works

1. **Set Variable**: You can specify the variable used in the equation (by default, it's `x`).
2. **Enter Equation**: You can enter any equation, e.g., `x^3 - x - 11`, and the app will automatically parse and prepare it for computation.
3. **Find Root**: The Bisection Method is used to find the root of the equation by narrowing the search range based on function sign changes.
4. **Output**: The root, its approximation, and the number of iterations are displayed.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Subhamsidhanta/Bisection-Method-Root-Finder.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage

1. Open the page in your browser.
2. Enter the desired variable (default is `x`).
3. Input your equation (e.g., `x^3 - x - 11`).
4. Click on the "Find Root" button, and the root will be displayed.

## Example

- Variable: `x`
- Equation: `x^3 - x - 11`
- Output: The root found through the Bisection Method, along with its approximation and the number of iterations.
